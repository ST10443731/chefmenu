ChefMenu App
Overview
The ChefMenu App is a project aimed at providing a dynamic restaurant menu system. The app was designed to allow chefs to manage menu items across three distinct courses (Starters, Main Courses, and Desserts). The chef was able to add new menu items, remove existing ones, and display the average prices for each course. It also allowed users to view the complete menu, and see the total bill for selected items.

Unfortunately, due to some last-minute technical difficulties, the app was not able to display or run as expected at the time of submission. However, all functionalities were implemented until the final stages.

Key Features
Menu Display: The app was designed to display the menu, broken down into three main courses (Starters, Main Courses, and Desserts).
Average Price Calculation: The app calculates and displays the average price for each course based on the menu items listed.
Chef Section: The chef could add and remove menu items from the list. Added items were to be stored in an array, and the app would reflect the changes dynamically.
User Interface: The app provided a simple and intuitive UI to navigate through the menu and view selected items.

Issues Faced
App Not Running: Despite several attempts to troubleshoot the issue, the app was not able to load or display the menu items correctly in the final stages. This may have been due to issues related to dependencies, the build process, or other configuration errors that occurred too late to resolve.

: The app was functioning as expected in earlier stages, with all core functionalities implemented. However, during the final testing phase, the app failed to load on the device, and I was unable to complete the final steps in time.

I made the following efforts to resolve the issues:

: I tried to reset the node modules and cleared the cache multiple times.
Updating Expo CLI and dependencies: I updated both the Expo CLI and related dependencies to ensure compatibility.
Testing on different environments: Attempted to run the app on both physical and virtual devices, as well as on the web, but encountered consistent failures.
: I spent significant time troubleshooting Metro bundler errors and trying to resolve missing module issues, but the app was not able to compile correctly in time.
Despite these efforts, the app was unable to function properly by the submission deadline.

Expected Features (Not Displayed)
: The chef was expected to add new items to the menu and remove any that were outdated. This was intended to be done through a simple form in the Chef Section.

: After adding or removing items, the app would update the display automatically, showing the new menu items and recalculating the average price of each course.

: The menu items were to be stored in an array and dynamically displayed, allowing for easy modification without restarting the app.

Video Submission
To further demonstrate the intended functionality of the app, I will also be submitting a video from my previous assignment. This video will show how the app was working prior to the issues that arose during the final stages of this assignment.

GitHub Repository
The app's source code is available in the GitHub repository linked below. It includes the initial implementation of the app, the features I was able to complete, and the issues I encountered during the final stages.

While the app was not running at the time of submission due to unforeseen technical issues, I hope the provided videos and the detailed steps taken to resolve the issue will provide a clear understanding of the work completed. I apologize for the inconvenience and hope the efforts made are taken into consideration.

Video Submission
To further demonstrate the intended functionality of the app, I will also be submitting a video two videos, one  from my previous assignmen and the other for the final POE. The first video will show how the app was working prior to the issues that arose during the final stages of this assignment and the last video will show the prigress made on the code.
